# Arch Linux Guide 2026

This is my 2026 created guide of all things archlinux I learned over the past 7 Years. It is based on my old installation guide and tested with the recent archlinux image (note the Readme notice). 

Tested Release: 2026.01.01

Feel free to Follow the Markdown Files by starting from the lowest number to the highest. On DE (Desktop Environments): Only select one is recommended.

If any error occures, feel free to create an issue.

Have fun and go the Arch way!

## !!!Welcome!!!

In this Installation Guide, I will explain my default Setup for ArchLinux with LUKS Drive-Encryption and EFI.

You can follow the full installation guide and choose a desktop environment to install.

For a much simpler installation using a Desktop Environment from a Live Arch Linux OS, feel free to use my Prebuild Arch Linux Live IMAGES on SourceForge.

**How to Copy Paste / Install these Commands**

If you downloaded my ArchLinux Live ISO with Desktop Environment:

* If you wish to copy them via copy and paste, feel free to use my installation live iso. (Burn it via Rufus or Balena Etcher and plug in the usb and boot from it.)

* Open this github page and open a terminal to start the process and follow the guide.

* Feel free to skip to Update Database (if you are connected  to the Internet)

On Original ArchLinux Iso:

* Until the Desktop Environment is installed, you need to type all commands by hand.

* After the desktop environment is installed, feel free to copy and paste the code snippes.
